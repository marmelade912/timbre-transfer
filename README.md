# Real-Time Timbre Transfer


This project utilizes nn~ object in Max and RAVE (Realtime Audio Variational autoEncoder). It allows the user to modify the pitch and timbre of the audio signals. 

Primarily made for live installations, audio signal is captured (voice in this case) via a microphone input.
